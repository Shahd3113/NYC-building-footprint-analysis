# 🗽 NYC Building Footprint Analysis

A data analysis and spatial visualization project focusing on the building footprints in New York City using official open-source geospatial data.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze building construction years, heights, and spatial distribution across NYC
- Detect trends and patterns per borough
- Visualize key metrics using maps and charts

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [NYC Open Data - BUILDING_P](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/BUILDING_P/u9wf-3gbt/about_data)
- Includes:
  - Geographic footprints of buildings
  - Construction year
  - Height above ground
  - Borough name
  - Unique identifiers (BIN, BBL, etc.)

## 🛠️ Steps

1. Imported necessary libraries (pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, folium, etc.)
2. Loaded the official NYC building dataset
3. Performed EDA to explore construction year, building height, and data quality
4. Cleaned data by handling nulls and dropping unnecessary fields
5. Created visualizations using:
   - Charts (bar, pie, histogram)
   - Interactive maps using Folium
6. Highlighted spatial patterns by borough and identified age clusters

- **Number of Buildings per Borough**  


## ✅ Key Insights

- Certain boroughs (like Manhattan) contain a high concentration of older buildings
- Recent constructions are clustered in specific zones
- Building heights vary greatly depending on borough and location
- Spatial analysis supports city planning and real estate decision-making
